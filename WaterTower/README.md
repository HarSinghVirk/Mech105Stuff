# Water Tower

## This problem was assigned to me as the homework. It calculates the volume of the water tank which is made up of cylinder and Frustum of a cone. When height exceeds 19 meters volume change because there is change in radius.

## Cylinder
The bright of the cylinder is 19 meters and width is 25 meters. 

Frustum of a cone (Inverted part in the picture. Check the pdf file for the question).
The diameter of the frustum of a cone is 46 meters and the height is 14 meters. The height may be specified but the volume for the frustum changes as the water level reaches to the walls in the region where height exceeds 19 meters.
