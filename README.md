# Introduction: Mech 105 Algorithms
This repository contains all the algorithms that are written for one of my class Mech 105 Applied Numerical Methods with MATLAB. There are some functions which are created based on the topics such as false position(for finding roots), LU factorization (decomposing A matrix to upper and lower triangular matrix) etc. There are some extra questions which were provided by my Professor Dr. Bechara. Please feel free to use these algorithms and try to find extra errors that I was unable to recognize.
