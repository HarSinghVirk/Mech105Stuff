# This function allows user to calculate the number of elapsed days in a year.

# Initializing Values:

# Inputs:
1) da = the day (1-31).
2) mo = the month (1-12). 
3) leap = Enter 1 for leap year and 0 for non-leap year.

# Outputs:
1) nd = number of elapsed days in a year.

# How to use the function:
 User have to enter the day, month and leap year(if they want to calculate the leap year). 
It will give an error if user inputs a number which is less than 1 or greater than 12 for month.  
Also gives an error if number of days exceeds 31 or subceeds 1.

# Switch, Case expressions/commands:
### The switch block tests each case until one of the case expressions is true.
 * For numbers, case_expression == switch_expression.
 * For character vectors, strcmp(case_expression,switch_expression) == 1.
 * For objects that support the eq function, case_expression == switch_expression.
 * For a cell array case_expression, at least one of the elements of the cell array matches switch_expression, as defined above for numbers, character vectors, and objects.
When a case expression is true, MATLABÂ® executes the corresponding statements and exits the switch block.
